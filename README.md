As we strive to find the best of the best to join our team, we believe that one of the most
effective ways to assess a person's technical skills is to put them to practice.

## Code Challenge: Sushi Shop ##

### Overview: ###

The challenge is to build a simulated sushi shop server-side program that takes orders from the 
customers, processes the orders in parallel, shows and updates the order status. 

The program should be built using the following configurations/frameworks/tools:

- Java 8
- Spring boot
- H2 database
- Maven/Gradle
- Any other libraries you feel you may need

### Requirements: ###

#### Server ####
The server should start on port **9000**

#### DB ####
Use an embedded in-memory H2 database with the following SQL to initialize the database when the server starts:  
 
```SQL
		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sushi; 
		CREATE TABLE sushi (  
			id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
			name VARCHAR(30),  
			time_to_make INT DEFAULT NULL  
		);  

		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sushi_order;  
		CREATE TABLE sushi_order (  
			id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
			status_id INT NOT NULL,  
			sushi_id INT NOT NULL,  
			createdAt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
		);  

		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS status;
		CREATE TABLE status (
			id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
		name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
		);

		INSERT INTO sushi (name, time_to_make) VALUES
			('California Roll', 30),
			('Kamikaze Roll', 40),
			('Dragon Eye', 50);

		INSERT INTO status (name) VALUES
			('created'),
			('in-progress'),
			('paused'),
			('finished'),
			('cancelled');
```

#### REST APIs ####

All the response bodies should include the following fields: 

- **code**: 0 for success, and any other integers for failures
- **msg**: A meaningful message represents the result
  
Build the following REST APIs that accepts and returns JSON data:

##### Submitting an order #####

- Method: **POST /api/orders**
- Request body:

``` JSON
		{
		  "sushi_name": "California Roll"
		}
```

- Response: 201

``` JSON
		{
		  "order": {
			"id": 10,
			"statusId": 1,
			"sushiId": 1,
			"createdAt": 1582643059540
		  },
		  "code": 0,
		  "msg": "Order created"
		}
```

- Only **three** chefs are available, thus only **three** orders can be processed at the same time
- When an order is submitted, the order record should be saved into database with status set to **"created"**
- When a chef is ready to process an order, the corresponding order record should be updated in the database with status set to **"in-progress"**
- The field **"time_to_make"** from sushi table represents how long it takes to make a specific kind of sushi. For example, a California Roll takes 30 seconds to make, thus a chef will be occupied for 30 seconds to finish making the sushi
- When an order is completed, the corresponding order record should be updated in the database with status set to **"finished"**


##### Cancelling an order #####

- Method: **DELETE /api/orders/{order_id}**
- Path parameter: **order_id**
- Response: 200

``` JSON
		{
		  "code": 0,
		  "msg": "Order cancelled"
		}
```

- The chef who is working on making the ordered sushi should stop upon cancellation request
- The order should be updated in the database with status set to **"cancelled"**

##### Displaying orders by status #####
- Method: **GET /api/orders/status**
- Response: 200

``` JSON
		{
		  "in-progress": [
			{
			  "orderId": 4,
			  "timeSpent": 23
			},
			{
			  "orderId": 5,
			  "timeSpent": 21
			}
		  ],
		  "created": [
			{
			  "orderId": 6,
			  "timeSpent": 0
			}
		  ],
		  "paused": [
			{
			  "orderId": 2,
			  "timeSpent": 5
			}
		  ],
		  "cancelled": [
			{
			  "orderId": 3,
			  "timeSpent": 6
			}
		  ],
		  "completed": [
			{
			  "orderId": 1,
			  "timeSpent": 30
			}
		  ]
		}
```

### Bonus: ###

##### Pausing an order #####

- Method: **PUT /api/orders/{order_id}/pause**
- Path parameter: **order_id**
- Response: 200

``` JSON
		{
		  "code": 0,
		  "msg": "Order paused"
		}
```

- When an order needs to be paused, the chef must pause the progress of making the sushi until the order is resumed
- The order should be updated in the database with status set to **"paused"**


##### Resuming an order #####

- Method: **PUT /api/orders/{order_id}/resume**
- Path parameter: **order_id**
- Response: 200

``` JSON
		{
		  "code": 0,
		  "msg": "Order resumed"
		}
```

- When an order needs to be paused, the chef must pause the progress of making the sushi until the order is resumed
- The order should be updated in the database with status set to **"paused"**
- When a resuming order request is received, the chef should continue to process the order with high priority. A resumed order should only be processed base on the remaining processing time. For example, an order of California Roll is paused after 20 seconds since the order became in-progress, then it should take 10 more seconds to finish once resumed
- The order should be updated in the database with status set to **"in-progress"** when it is resumed and **"finished"** upon completion
